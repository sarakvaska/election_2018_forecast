# election_2018_forecast

 Here is my forecast: 
 
 - Democrats will win the House 
 - Republicans will win the Senate
 
For this election, there's been an overwhelming push for voter turnout. People have begun to think of voting in terms of, "It doesn't matter who you vote for. It matters that you vote." According to Voter Turnout, only 36.7% of people voted in the 2016 midterm elections. Historically, many people have not voted in the midterm elections. This lack of turnout and, therefore, lack of representation has led to elections of those who do not represent the majority of the people. This time around, people have been determined to vote -- determined to remove those who do not represent the people's values from office. There has already been an increase in early voting, and since the presidential election there's also been a hike in people's dislike for the Republican party. I am forecasting that Democrats will take the House with at least 239 seats. To win, they need to reclaim 45 currently held Republican seats. Democrats already hold 194. I am forecasting that Republicans will win the Senate. This forecast is based on the fact that Democrats must win more than three times more seats in the Senate than Republicans while keeping the seats they currently have.
